            an Italian performance artist who, as part of a project to promote world peace, had been

            an account of the injustice Léger’s mother endured during her divorce.  Léger grapples
            with her inability to understand the motivations of others, and with the ambiguity of
            giving voice to the silenced, noting that Bacca’s killer had, in the days before he was
